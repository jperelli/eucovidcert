# eucovidcert

This is a simple **UNOFFICIAL** application to read the QR of the EU covid certificate and show all the information the QR contains.

Use it here: https://eucovidcert.vercel.app

Main decoder is comprised of just a few lines of code here https://github.com/jperelli/eucovidcert/blob/main/components/QrDecoder.tsx#L14...L27

# Disclaimer

This is not an official application. It is just a fun project I did over the weekend.

# Thanks

Inspired in reading the wtf QR info and then seeing this tweet https://twitter.com/Ewjoachim/status/1408840626678996997
